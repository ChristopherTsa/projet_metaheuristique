# Multidimensional Knapsack Problem Solver

This project provides a comprehensive framework to solve the **Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP)** using various heuristics and metaheuristics, including **Simulated Annealing**, **Genetic Algorithms**, and **Hybrid Approaches**. The goal is to efficiently maximize the profit while respecting multiple resource constraints.

## **1. Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following main directories and files:

### **Main Components**
- **`app.py`**: 
  The entry point of the project. It contains testing functions to run the implemented heuristics and metaheuristics on provided instances.
  
- **`heuristics/`**: 
  Contains heuristic algorithms for solving MKP:
  - `greedy_heuristic.py`: Implements a greedy algorithm based on profit-to-resource ratio.
  - `repair_heuristic.py`: A function to repair infeasible solutions.

- **`hill_climbing/`**: 
  Contains the hill climbing algorithm and related neighborhood generation functions:
  - `hill_climbing.py`: Implements the hill climbing metaheuristic.
  - `neighborhoods.py`: Functions to generate neighborhoods for optimization.
  - `vns.py`: Implements the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm.

- **`metaheuristic/`**: 
  Implements advanced optimization methods:
  - `genetic_metaheuristic.py`: Solves MKP using a genetic algorithm.
  - `simulated_annealing_metaheuristic.py`: Simulated annealing implementation.
  - `sa_iga_metaheuristic.py`: A hybrid approach combining Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).

- **`utilities.py`**: 
  Contains helper functions, such as profit calculations and feasibility checks.

### **Data Directories**
- **`instances/`**: 
  Contains problem instance files (e.g., `mknapcb1.txt`) that define resource constraints, item profits, and consumption for MKP.

- **`optimal_values/`**: 
  Contains reference files with optimal values for the corresponding instances.

### **Results Directories**
- **`results/`**: 
  Contains the output of the algorithms, such as solutions for specific instances (e.g., `mknap1.csv`).

- **`Final_results/`**: 
  Contains performance analyses of the algorithms, including:
  - `Performances_genetic.xlsx`: Performance analysis of the Genetic Algorithm.
  - `Performances_greedy_repair.xlsx`: Analysis of Greedy + Repair heuristic.
  - `Performances_hill_climbing.xlsx`: Analysis of the Hill Climbing algorithm.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **3. Usage**

To run the project, execute the main script `app.py`:
```bash
python app.py
```

`app.py` contains predefined test cases that run the implemented heuristics and metaheuristics on the provided MKP instances.

### Example:
- To solve a specific instance using a hybrid SA+GA approach, adjust the function calls in `app.py` accordingly.

## **4. Algorithm Overview**

The following methods are implemented in this project:

### **Heuristics**
- **Greedy Heuristic**: Selects items based on their profit-to-resource ratio.
- **Repair Heuristic**: Repairs infeasible solutions by removing items that violate constraints.

### **Metaheuristics**
- **Hill Climbing**: Optimizes a solution iteratively by exploring its neighborhood.
- **Simulated Annealing**: Introduces probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions to escape local optima.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Uses selection, crossover, and mutation operators to evolve a population of solutions.
- **Hybrid Approach (SA+GA)**: Combines Simulated Annealing with Genetic Algorithm to balance exploitation and exploration.

## **5. Results and Analysis**

- **Results**:
  The `results/` directory contains the solutions generated by the algorithms in `.csv` format.

- **Analysis**:
  The `Final_results/` directory includes Excel files comparing the performance of different approaches.
